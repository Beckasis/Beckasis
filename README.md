I am
here because I have questions regarding for as much as I have figured out on my own 
are programs on my PC. I did not know where to go for info.
I have seen this sites name repeatedly, so here I am. 
I would like to know how to read the programs to know what they are for. I have figured a small bit out on my own like reading between the lines.
I also know that my pc has a remote access on it to send to another location.
All my admin settings have been redone. Half of my PC I no longer even have access to.
I can't even restore it to a place before this was all done. I have been trying to figure it out for 3 months, but I am just goin g in circles.
I am sorry for wasting your time, but I do not know where to turn, I don't want to pay a ton, or lose my stuff. I would also like to know what some of this stuff is.
From what I have been able to figure out so far, It is very cool. and extremely interesting.
Oh yes. It was all done by a psycho Ex who I really hope is still seeing everything I am doing cause I will figure it out!
Thank you and again So Sorry.
